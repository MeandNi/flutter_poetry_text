/// This class finds locations in a string of text where it would be appropriate
/// to break the line so that it can soft wrap. It uses a very simplistic
/// algorithm that will break the text between a space character and a non-space
/// character. This is enough for common purposes but it does not conform to
/// the Unicode standards for text breaking locations. Minikin in Flutter's
/// LibTxt contains a LineBreaker class, but at the time of this writing it has
/// not been exposed in dart:ui.
